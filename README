# FOSSDIO
## TODO
- [x] Working Proof of Concept for 1 directory
- [ ] Working Proof of Concept for multiple directories (a real music library)
- [ ] Add a config file for directory settings
- [ ] Options for other file formats, both input and ouput
- [ ] A way to package this for ease of use, or possibly even as a daemon.

## Outline
The goal of this project is to convert audio files that are not free from patents (only MP3's at the moment, but I may add more as needed) into .opus files, which is created by the [Xiph Organization](https://www.opus-codec.org/) and is believed to be free from patents. At the moment this project is very bare bones, but we'll see how much more gets added. 

## Usage
First, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Armory8854/fossdio.git
```

Then, cd into the repo, create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the requirements
```
cd fossdio
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, change the directory that hosts your mp3 files in bin/main.py
```
...
music_dir = "/path/to/an/album/"
```
